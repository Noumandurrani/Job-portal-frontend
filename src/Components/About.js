          perspectives and reframe negative thoughts. Start by cultivating
          self-awareness and paying attention to your inner dialogue. Replace
          self-limiting beliefs with positive affirmations and empowering
          statements. By changing the way you perceive challenges and setbacks,

          or expressing appreciation to others. Cultivating an attitude of
          gratitude trains your mind to seek the positive aspects in every
